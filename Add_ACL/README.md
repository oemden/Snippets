# Add  ACL to a local folder

When I  need to ad ACL to a folder.

Mainly on a oldy macOs Server Share binded to an AD if I remember.

###  Use as follow:

 `Add_ACL.sh "User" "/Some/Path/to a Folder/you/want/to/Add/ACL/to"`

 User can be a local or OpenDirectory User and even AD user if you use double backslash `\\`
 
#### Many  TODOs to do :

like :

- precheck if ACL allready exists
- remove ACLs
-  ...
